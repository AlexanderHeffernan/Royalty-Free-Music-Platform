**About Royalty Free Music(RFM)**

Royalty Free Music(RFM) is a website that hosts a library of free music. Our website is aimed/targeted specifically towards all creators, such as filmmakers, who require quick and free access to music for their creative projects. Around the web, there are websites that provide the same services we are giving, but they are based on paid subscriptions. However, there are several free royalty free image services around the web, such as unsplash.com and pixabay.com. Our aim was to combine these two services into one, taking the high quality music aspects of paid services along with the royalty free nature of websites like unsplash.com.
