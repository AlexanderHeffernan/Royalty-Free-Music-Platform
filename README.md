# Welcome to Royalty Free Music (RFM) 

**About Royalty Free Music(RFM)**

With a team of 3 other developers and designers, I created a website that allows its users, such as filmmakers and other content creators, infinite access to a large library of royalty free music. The platform, named Royalty Free Music (RFM), has four main pages, including the Home page which introduces new users to the website, as well as provides a list of the most listened to, most downloaded, and most recent songs. The next page is the Explore page, which allows users to search, filter, and sort through the entire collections of songs the website holds. The next page is the Library page, which allows users to view their liked songs, as well as whatever playlists they have created. Finally, there is the Account page, which allows users, particularly those looking to use the platform to distribute their royalty free songs, a dashboard to view their analytics, all their previously released songs, as well upload more songs to the platform. Through a modern and aesthetically pleasing user interface, efficient searching, filtering and sorting tools, and a 100% guarantee that any track hosted on the website is royalty free, creators can easily find music for their projects.

**Update log:**

*February:*

* 20/02/2021 - Creation of the original concepts for the website. As a group, simple ideas were put together with pen and paper and the original idea for RFM was born.

*March:*

* 05/03/2021 - Using Adobe XD, the initital website designs were created by Tobey Lim and Benj Baniqued. The first pages (wave one) designed were the home page and the login page. We decided to use Adobe XD because of the many features it came with and because it could be quickly mastered by our design team. User feedback helped us choose the colour scheme, how to format the content, and how to plan out the information architecture.

* 31/03/2021 - Original finalisation of the home page and the login page developed and running on all of our local servers. We decided to code the website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP. This is because each member of our team specilised in one of these programming lanuages and new the basics of the others. For instance, Lokesh Dhade and Benj Baniqued were great at using HTML and CSS to make near perfect replicas of the original designs into web form while keeping it all 100% reponsive. Alex Heffernan specilised in JavaScript and PHP, so was in charge of the back-end systems of the website. Tobey Lim helped all round, but spent most of his time creating the designs with Adobe XD.

*April:*

* Further designs (wave one continued) for the website were created. This time, Tobey Lim and Benj Baniqued had prepared designs for the Explore page and About page. These designs were consistent towards the original Home page and Login page, and perfectly came together with the previous designs. At this point, further end-user feedback should have been conducted to identify the need for a Library page, as well as an Account/Dashboard page, rather than later in the development process in June.

*May:*

* 24/5/21 - Final changes to all previously created designs were made. A collection of designs were put together and ready for the development team to fully implement into web form.

*June:*

* 1/6/21 - Making RFM responsive to all devices suddenly became very important to us. We decided it was important to us because our website was all about providing a quick and free service to all creators who are after music for their projects. It was important to us that our users could access this service from anywhere and with great efficiency, so the design team (Tobey Lim and Benj Baniqued) set out to put together a collection of mobile-friendly designs for the website. The development team also began to prepare the website for this transition to a completely responsive UI.

* 12/6/21 - The decision was made to implement a Library page (wave two) into the site. We decided to do this before from user feedback, we realised it was important for our end users to be able to create and save playlists of songs to allow them to come back to our website and quickly find songs/tracks they were previously interested in or liked. It would also allow users to customize who they interact with our site. For instance, users could create a playlist for each project they are currently working on. We also decided, from user feedback, that it would be important to create a Dashboard page (wave two continued) for users who want to upload their own music to the website. We wanted to allow our users to quickly view statistics (such as listens, likes, downloads, et cetera) and upload new songs/tracks to the website with ease. This page would later be renamed to the Account Page, and would also allow users to change their profile picture, username, email address and password. So, the design team (Tobey Lim and Benj Baniqued) set out to create the new collection of designs, while the develpoment team (Alex Heffernan and Lokesh Dhade) prepared the website for the new pages.

*July:*

* After months of hard work, we decided to have the month off from development, as this month also coincided with the Term 2 holidays. This break allowed our team to leave the website for a few weeks, and return later with a refreshed and reenergised perspective on the project.

*August:*

* 27/8/21 - The design team (Tobey Lim and Benj Baniqued) finalised the collection of designs for all pages of the website, including the newly thought of Dashboard/Account page and Library page. The design team now merged with the development team to finalise the project before the deadline. We did this because we knew our design team also had great skills when it came to the development stage of making a website, and now that all designs were finished it would be silly to not bring them into the development team.

*September:*

* 03/9/21 - The full team (Alex Heffernan, Lokesh Dhade, Benj Baniqued, and Tobey Lim) finalised the project. The website was fully functional and was exactly as intended. The project was now ready to be submitted for marking. In the months following, only minor improvements would be made to the website to ensure ease of setting up on new devices and to futureproof.

**Requirements and other important ideas we had to consider during the design and development process of Royalty Free Music (RFM)**

*Social:*

RFM allows users to listen and download songs for free, allowing for infinite use in creative projects (both commercial and personal). This is greatly beneficial to society, which meets the social implication of the website. We also decided not to upload any explicit songs to the website as to not offend others, allowing for a positive social environment.

*Cultural:*

Cultural implications were addressed by only uploading content to the website that was not offesnsive to any cultural background. All the content uploaded to the site was only uploaded if relevant to requirements we had in place. Everyonce in a while we would also share our website with others, to ensure there is nothing cultural innappropriate that we've missed. However, so far nothing cultural innappropriate has been identified, meaning this implication has been addressed.

*Legal: (Requirement 1)*

The implication of Legality is a significant aspect of our project. Songs on our website must be royalty free. That way users can enter into our website and download any songs to use freely. This ensures trust within our users. To ensure all the music on our site is royalty free, we started off the site by uploading songs created by Tobey Lim (member of design team and later the development team) who agreed to making his songs/tracks royalty free. To further ensure all the music on the site is royalty free, users must confirm that the music is theirs and royalty free before uploading to the website.

*Ethical:*

Users have to agree that any music they upload to the website is 100% their own and 100% royalty free. If a users does not accept these terms and uploads something that they either do not own or is not royalty free, their music will be removed from the website and their account will be suspended indefinitely.

*Intellectual Property:*

Intellectual property is a license and ownership of digital property. Our project RFM addresses this implication because the content provided on the website is royalty free which is material that is able to be used without payment of royalties or license fees. The project RFM abides by IP so that the goal of RFM to distribute content and provide music is able to have the rights to do so.

*Privacy:*

Our project addresses the implication of privacy by keeping the users who use our services personal information private. The login information users input into the website is encrypted so that only authorized parties can access sensitive information. This prevents attacks and data breaches to our users

*Accessibility: (Requirement 2)*

By making our website responsive it can be accessible on both large and smaller screen devices such as laptops, monitors, tablets and phones. This is an important part of the ux aspect of the website. It also had to be accessible on every browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge, et cetera).

*Usability: (Requirement 3)*

Over the course of the project we continue to find more ways to add pages and features into the website. Playlists, download songs, profile customization and adding songs were things we found necessary for our users to do.

*Functionality:*

By adding the double hamburger nav we made the website twice as functional. Every song on the website has been tagged appropriately to make finding songs effective.

*Health and Safety:*

Users cannot interact or rate songs. This means that harassment and bullying cannot be found on our website.

*Aesthetics:*

For our website, the aim was to create a modern, functional and practical design that had a great user interface and user experience. These two were very instrumental throughout the design phase and throughout the project building phase. 
For the home page, we knew we needed to make accessing our content as easy as possible, so we built a simplistic splash screen that had a search bar built right into the middle of the screen, a signup and login link in the top right corner, along with a few sentences explaining what the website is about. From there the main elements of the home page were finalised. 
Next, the homepage went through several iterations and design ideas before we finally settled on the final design. The different iterations we looked at considered the different aesthetics and creativity that would attract our target audience. This included a colour change and several repositioning of different elements and swapping out images.

*Future-proofing:*

Future ideas include a mobile app for both Android and IOS. Health and safaty imporvement could incluce explicit detection algorithm.Better terms and conditions. Copyright detection algorithm.
